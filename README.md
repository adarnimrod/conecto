## About this project

This project aims to provide a KDEConnect client designed for elementary OS, based on [mconnect](https://github.com/kevinselvaprasanna/mconnect).

Conecto is based on [EOSConnect](https://github.com/gyan000/EOSConnect) by gyan000. Unfortunately he wasn't able to continue development because he didn't own an android device anymore.

This project is a work in progress, not intended for daily use.

Current features include:
 - Connecting to the android device
 - Pinging the device
 - Sharing files through devices
 - Showing the battery level
 - Receiving notifications
 - Sending SMS
